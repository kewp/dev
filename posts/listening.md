the one who listens more knows more.

say i am stating facts and then i ask various people questions to determine who listened.
"the ball is green and it weighs 5kg".
the one who can repeat these clearly listened.

sam harris has read through all the opinions of consciousness.
his opinion is better than someone who hasn't heard those opinions.
if you were to say to them "what about this?" and their response
misrepresented the argument, or they ignored you, or did anything that
showed they had not put the argument into view / practice,
then their opinion is devalued. it cannot stand for a definitive view.

but listening to facts is different than listening to an explanation.
"karl crossed the road because he was hungry".
it's not a fact. it's...

i can't remember where i was going with this.
somehow the idea of listening, of one person trying to 'listen' to another,
just conseptualising that... it seems you can clearly determine if you were listened
to or not. and that means something. you can start there in order to build
up an idea of the human mind. what does it look like when someone has listened to you?
what does it look like when they don't? could you build something that just listens
and can only prove it listened by talking? it would need to tell you that something you
said didn't make sense.

"johnny is ten years old"
_what do you mean by 'johnny' and 'ten years old'?_
"johnny is a boy's name, and 'ten years old' is how old johnny is"
_what is 'boy', 'name' and 'how old'?_

this would go on forever. it all boils down to consciousness, which no machine has.
